Mr Tatenda has given out a group assignment, group membership is shown above, some students have a tendency to copy from each other and thus cannot sit together on the same table, these students are indicated in the list below.

Taiwo can’t sit with Magura
Fabrice can’t sit with Maysa
Ruth can’t sit with Taiwo
Ken can’t sit with Taiwo
Masupa can’t sit with Taiwo
You are asked to arrange the students on tables for them to do assignments

Constraints:

Students in same group should be seated on the same table
Students who tend to copy from each other should not sit on the same table
Goal:

Find the minimal number of tables required for the sitting arrangement

Hint: graph coloring

Question 2

African Leadership University is designing its examination time table for this term as it comes to an end, unfortunately due corona problem, only two large rooms are available to accommodate the students considering the social distancing condition.

As a computing student who has studied efficient ways of handling specific problems from your computing classes, you have been asked to help in designing the time-table

Constraint:

No student should be required to sit for more than one exam at the same time

Goal:

Find the minimum (time slots) to accommodate all the exams without violating the above constrain.

Only two exams can be scheduled within the same time-slot (refer to room availability stated above)

The table below indicates relationship between student and courses, an intersection between two courses (represented with an X) means there is at least one or more students taking both courses

A time-slot: is an exam session time e.g 9.00 am - 11. 00 am can be said to be a time-slot, and in this time slot, only two exams can be run due to room availability.
